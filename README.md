# Image_processing
Basic image processing program for grayscale images (.pgm format).
It is not a strictly object oriented code, I just tried to separate the different subtasks a bit.
I made it mainly for learning and practicing, so it surely could be better, there are a few things I
would do differently now, but it just works fine.
